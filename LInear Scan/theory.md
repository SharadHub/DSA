### Linear Scan ###


Linear Search is also known as sequential algorithm, where in the list or aaray we search in sequence for a desired element until it is found or until the end of the list.

*** This algorithm is uses when the dataset is small or we have to search for an element in a sequential order. The list or array should be unsorted for this alogorithm to perform. ***
