### Linear Scan ###


Linear Search is also known as sequential algorithm, where in the list or aaray we search in sequence for a desired element until it is found or until the end of the list.

- This algorithm is uses when the dataset is small or we have to search for an element in a sequential order. 
- The list or array should be unsorted for this alogorithm to perform.
- This search process start by comparing search element with the first element of array or list.
- If both elements matched, then print "ELement found" otherwise move on to the next element. Likewise, repeat the same process until the last element. 
- If none of the elements match with search element then print "Element not found" or something like that.
- Then at last terminate the function.

### It's Advantages are: ###

- works great with small datasets.
- array or list do not necessarily need to be sorted.
-
